# Spotify-Machine-Learning
A cool way to predict the mood of music tracks with Neural Networks models using Keras and Tensorflow Libraries on Python. Music is a powerful language to express our feelings and in many cases is used as a therapy to deal with tough moments in our lives. Emotions and moods can be easily reflected in music, when we are doing sports, we tend to listen to energetic music, similarly when we are anxious or tired a nice relaxed song can help us to calm down. Thatâ€™s why I try to figure out how classification models could help to determinate which is the mood of a specific track.
Required Tools:
- Pandas and Numpy for data analysis.
- Keras and Tensorflow to build the Deep Learning model.
- Sklearn to validate the model.
- Seaborn and Matplotlib to plot a nice graph.
- Spotipy Python Library (click here for more info).
- Spotify Credentials to access their Apis and Data acquisition (click here for more info).
